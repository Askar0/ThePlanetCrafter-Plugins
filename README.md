          These will need testing and possibly additional updates before release versions will be made available.
```

## Currently Intended Support for Game Versions:
ℹ️ Current Early Access / Experimental (Possibly)

:warning: I'll do my best to keep my mods up-to-date in case something drastic changes inside the main game.

:warning: I may not have tested my mods with some versions of the developer/preview/demo releases. They might work just fine or suddenly break.

:warning: I cannot promise to fix my mods for these other versions as they can get quite out-of-sync with the public release.

**Note:** I am still in the process of creating the form and code for my mods/plugins and currently not working on the release versions yet. Please be patient.

## Preparation

In order to use my or anyone else's mods at this time, you need to install BepInEx first. The wiki has a guide for this:

Planet Crafter Modding Wiki pages: https://planet-crafter.fandom.com/wiki/Modding#Using_Mods

Guide on dnSpy-based manual patches: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2784319459

## Installation

When installing my mods, unzip the mod into the `BepInEx\Plugins` directory, using the zipfile name (without the zip extension) as the folder to store the plugins in.

You should end up having a directory structure like this:

```
`BepInEx\Plugins\Askar0-(UI) Minimap-Core Plugin\Askar0.Minimap.Core_v1-0.dll`
`BepInEx\Plugins\Askar0-(UI) Minimap-UI Plugin\Askar0.Minimap.UI_v1-0.dll`
`BepInEx\Plugins\Askar0-(UI) Minimap-GUI Plugin\Askar0.Minimap.GUI_v1-0.dll`
`BepInEx\Plugins\Askar0-(UI-Mod) Minimap-Mod-Helper Plugin\Askar0.Minimap.Mod-Helper_v1-0.dll`
`BepInEx\Plugins\Askar0-(UI-Mod) Minimap-Mod-Helper Plugin\mods\` #Etc Etc.
```

Note: I intend to add folder names and subfolders to the release versions of the plugins but at the moment I am just testing the mods so they may or may not already have folders setup in the zipfiles.

Doing this helps avoid overwriting each others' files if they happen to be named the same as well as allows removing plugin files together 
by deleting the directory itself.
